			"Every plan covers the same six service families. Free covers core management with limited history and community support. Pro raises quotas and adds advanced automation, members, permissions and priority support. Enterprise adds governance, extended audit, dedicated infrastructure and contractual support. Infrastructure consumption is billed on top of the subscription in every plan.",
	},
	{
		question: "Are infrastructure resources included in the subscription?",
		answer:
			"No. A subscription pays for the platform: features, management quotas, automation and support. CPU, memory, storage, traffic, addresses, backups and dedicated servers are metered separately — or paid to your own provider when you run Self.",
	},
	{
		question: "What happens when I exceed my quotas?",
		answer:
			"Management quotas cap what the platform allows you to create or operate on the current plan. When a threshold is reached, the additional action is blocked until the quota is raised. The behaviour of each quota is stated with the plan, and no overage is charged silently.",
	},
	{
		question: "Can I upgrade or downgrade my subscription?",
		answer:
			"Yes. A plan change is made from the console and applies from the next billing period unless the agreement says otherwise. A downgrade requires the workspace to fit within the lower quotas before it is applied.",
	},
	{
		question: "Can I use ZenthCloud without subscribing to Cloud?",
		answer:
			"Yes. ZenthCloud Self runs on infrastructure you control, with no Cloud subscription and no Cloud account.",
	},
	{
		question: "Is ZenthCloud Self free to use?",
		answer:
			"The open-source core is free to self-host. Enterprise capabilities, such as advanced RBAC, audit and white labelling, require a commercial licence. Support and onboarding are separate services.",
	},
	{
		question: "What is the difference between Cloud, Self and Hybrid?",
		answer:
			"Cloud is operated by Sky Genesis Enterprise and billed as a subscription. Self is installed and operated by you. Hybrid joins the two: a central control plane with local installations that keep operating autonomously.",
	},
	{
		question: "Can I connect my own infrastructure providers?",
		answer:
			"ZenthCloud is designed to manage infrastructure across providers rather than lock a workspace to one. Self and Hybrid are the modes for infrastructure you already operate; supported providers and integrations are documented in the product documentation and added as they are verified.",
	},
	{
		question: "Is Dedicated Bare Metal included in Pro or Enterprise?",
		answer:
			"No. A dedicated server is a separate resource billed per server. It can be attached to a Pro or Enterprise workspace and managed from the same control plane, but it is never included in the subscription.",
	},
	{
		question: "How does infrastructure consumption billing work?",
		answer:
			"Consumption is metered per unit — vCPU-hours, GB-months, transferred traffic or address-months, for example — and invoiced alongside the subscription, with platform and infrastructure lines kept separate. Unit rates are not published yet; they will show the amount, currency and billing interval per resource.",
	},
	{
		question: "What support is included in each plan?",
		answer:
			"Free includes documentation and community support. Pro includes priority support. Enterprise includes contractual support with an SLA and technical onboarding. A response commitment exists only where the agreement states one.",
	},
	{
		question: "Can I migrate from Self to Cloud or Hybrid?",
		answer:
			"Yes. Both modes use the same control plane model, so a Self installation can be connected to a Cloud workspace in Hybrid, or moved to a Cloud subscription. Scope, data transfer and downtime are agreed in writing before the change.",
