		description:
			"Instance, GPU, bare metal and private cloud plans. Prices are not published yet.",

			"Compute is billed either hourly for elastic workloads or monthly for reserved capacity. Every plan below is modelled in the catalogue with its billing model and conditions; none has an approved price, so the interface shows “Price not published” rather than a number.",
		families: ["compute"],

			"Hourly plans are intended to stop billing when the resource is deleted.",

		description:
			"Object, block and backup storage, billed by capacity and retention.",
