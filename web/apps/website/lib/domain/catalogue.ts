 * - No price is published until it has been approved (`status: "draft"`,
 *   `amountMinor: null`).
 * - Regions that have not been contractually verified cannot be marked
 *   commercially available.
 * - Products never reference a specific infrastructure supplier in their
 *   copy; supplier data only lives in availability entries.
 * - Availability and delivery model are separate fields. A service in this
 *   list is not orderable unless its regional entries say so.
 *
 * The dataset is intentionally small and explicit. It is designed to be
 * replaced by a public catalogue API later without changing the page
 * templates: see `queries.ts` for the access layer.
